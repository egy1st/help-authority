<h1><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">
<font color="#000080" size="4">DC Help Authority<br>
</font></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal">DC Help 
Authority is the only program that lets you create online help files from any 
point in your program. It helps you write multiple help topics, assign them to 
different areas, and link to them from anywhere, down to the smallest grid and 
column. With DC Help Authority, you can give your application a unique edge by 
making it more comprehensive, intuitive, and user-friendly.</span></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">
<font color="#000080" size="4">Context-sensitive help<br>
</font></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal">Instead of 
loading one large help file, DC Help Authority divides it into separate topics 
that describe each state, situation, or feature of your program. Each topic is 
linked to the corresponding code, so that accessing Help will lead to the help 
file linked to that area – much like Microsoft’s WinHelp. This way, your users 
won’t have to search keywords or scroll through pages of text.</span></h1>
<h1><font color="#000080" size="4">
<span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">COM-based operation<br>
</span></font><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">DC Help Authority 
runs on all COM-based applications such as Borland C++, Delphi, Visual Basic, 
and Visual Basic C++. It uses a simple, easy-to-remember syntax, so your help 
code only needs a few lines of text and works with major programming languages. 
The Configuration Utility also allows you to determine which languages can be 
used with DC Help Authority.</font></span></h1>
<h1><font color="#000080" size="4">
<span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">Customizable fields<br>
</span></font><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">In the Help 
Authority system, the sensitive help feature can be triggered by the F12 key. 
For example, you can create and define four fields in a table, label it “Help,” 
and paste it onto your project code. The fields Tag, Id, Description, and 
Contents can be defined accordingly (text or memo) and assigned specific 
lengths.</font></span></h1>

<span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">Easy installation and 
setup<br>
</span></font><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">You do not need to 
be an advanced programmer in order to install and fully use Help Authority. Its 
setup program automatically registers the Dc_HelpAuthority10.dll file on your 
system. To integrate it into your project, simply select 'add reference' from 
the project menu.&nbsp; Click the 'browse' button to locate all of these&nbsp; DLL </font>
